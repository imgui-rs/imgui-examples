# imgui-examples

This crate is a collection of examples for [imgui](https://github.com/imgui-rs/imgui-rs).
Much more information on how to use `imgui` can be found at that repository. This repository
can show examples of how to use `imgui`'s API and, to a lesser extent, how to setup an
`imgui` platform and renderer.
